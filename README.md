###SUMMARY### I’m a Front End Engineer and lifelong learner with a background in communications, marketing, and advertising. Those who work closely with me describe me as persistent, courageous, and people oriented: I love to coordinate and lead as part of a caring, hardworking team. I can often be found contributing to open source projects, discovering bugs on a quest to always improve the software I work on, and writing to help others learn new technical concepts. Having lived in Ethiopia and Tanzania for 4 years, I’m eager to tackle systemic problems with a multidisciplinary, empathetic approach. I’m passionate about blockchain, and emergent technology that creates innovative means of access and opportunity. In my free time, you’ll find me playing guitar, eating different ethnic foods, cycling, and watching foreign film.
